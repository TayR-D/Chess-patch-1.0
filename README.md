# Chess-patch-1.0
Playable chess game, more like a sandbox where there are no rules. This is my final project submission for DES103 - OOP LAB at SIIT

This project is my take on making a Chess game. I made it so that the piece are able to move to whereever it can on the board, 
though some basic Chess rules is still present i.e a white piece will still kill a black piece when taking the black piece's square and vice versa.
In addition, I made a side panel with options like a chess clock, the ability to add extra piece to the board, and a reset button. 

Hope you enjoy.
